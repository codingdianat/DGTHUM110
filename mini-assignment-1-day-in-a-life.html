Similar to other day in a life videos, my friend is shown going through the motions of the day: brushing teeth, going to class, studying etc. There is a bit of a twist because their desire to nap is personified as a Snorlax stuffy who is insistent on getting my friend to return to bed. I was inspired by how well the documentary, The Social Dilemna, utilizes the seven elements of effective storytelling to make facts more entertaining. I was specifically inspired by how they personified the social media apps. Since my Publii website is very early in development, I do not believe that my website is ready for my final project. I envision that this website will hold my final project and have a seamless user experience. I believe that my website will be interactive and require users to scroll through my page. One change that I would like is to incorporate more features that Publii does not have. For example, I  would like to include a slow reveal or some animations. This would require me to incorporate HTML/CSS, which I do not have a ton of experience in. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, my experience creating the short film was very entertaining and insightful. I believe that I was able to effectively capture my main idea in a creative way. I was very pleased with how the incorporation of a stuffed animal highlighted the main point of my film. One major surprise throughout the filming process was how long it took to capture all the shots. I was under the false impression that the entire filming process for this two minute video would take under an hour; it ended up taking almost two hours! I realized that in order to tell the story that I wanted, I had to be very articulate about the scenes that I am capturing. I learned that the way that a scene is shot influences the mood that it creates. In addition to how a scene is shot, the music that is played behind a video also influences the mood. I found that I was scrolling through all 200 free imovie sound samples looking for the perfect sound. I initially picked a song that did not match the vibe that I was going for. I did not recognize the issue at first and was confused why my video did not portray what I wanted. After incorporating the right soundtrack, text and videos, I was able to create a short film that I was proud of.</span></p><p><br><br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 23, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://codingdianat.github.io/DGTHUM110/authors/diana-tran/" rel="author">Diana Tran</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</p><p>Made by Diana Tran</p><p> </p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://codingdianat.github.io/DGTHUM110/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://codingdianat.github.io/DGTHUM110/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
